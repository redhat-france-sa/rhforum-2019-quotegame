## Deploying the demo on OpenShift

### Preparing infrastructure services

For this demo, we need to have a sole OpenShift project/namespace with a Kafka broker installed.

Start creating a new project once logged into your OpenShift cluster, call it `quotegame-rhforum` for example. You'll also need to add privileged access to the default service account as Quarkus native images require that.

```
$ oc new-project quotegame-rhforum --display-name="RH Forum Quote game"
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n quotegame-rhforum 
```

Now install the *AMQ Streams* operator (AMQ Streams is the Red Hat Kafka distribution) using the Operator Lifecycle Manager from the CLI.

```sh
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: quotegame-rhforum
  namespace: quotegame-rhforum
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - quotegame-rhforum
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: amq-streams
  namespace: quotegame-rhforum
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: amq-streams
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
```

As an alternative, you can choose to deploy the upstream community operator that is called Strimzi.

Now install the *Infinispan* operator using the Operator Lifecycle Manager from the CLI.

```sh
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: infinispan
  namespace: quotegame-rhforum
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: infinispan
  source: community-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
```

### Deploying infrastructure services

From now, we'll use the Kubernetes manifest placed into the `/openshift` subfolder of the Git repository.

Deploy a Kafka broker to the project:

```
$ oc create -f openshift/00-kafka.yaml -n quotegame-rhforum
```

Wait for a few minutes and you should get the following:

```
$ oc get pods
NAME                                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amq-streams-cluster-operator-74896b74bb-64tr7   1/1       Running   1          4h
my-cluster-entity-operator-7777b975fc-nslvj     3/3       Running   0          16m
my-cluster-kafka-0                              2/2       Running   3          4h
my-cluster-kafka-1                              2/2       Running   3          4h
my-cluster-kafka-2                              2/2       Running   4          4h
my-cluster-zookeeper-0                          2/2       Running   2          4h
my-cluster-zookeeper-1                          2/2       Running   2          4h
my-cluster-zookeeper-2                          2/2       Running   2          4h
```

Deploy an Infinispan server to the project

```sh
oc create secret generic infinispan-configuration --from-file=infinispan/ -n quotegame-rhforum
oc apply -f openshift/00-statefulset-infinispan.yaml -n quotegame-rhforum
```

Wait for a few minutes and you should get the following:

```
$ oc get pods
NAME                                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amq-streams-cluster-operator-74896b74bb-64tr7   1/1       Running   1          4h
infinispan-0                                    1/1       Running   1          2h
my-cluster-entity-operator-7777b975fc-nslvj     3/3       Running   0          16m
my-cluster-kafka-0                              2/2       Running   3          4h
my-cluster-kafka-1                              2/2       Running   3          4h
my-cluster-kafka-2                              2/2       Running   4          4h
my-cluster-zookeeper-0                          2/2       Running   2          4h
my-cluster-zookeeper-1                          2/2       Running   2          4h
my-cluster-zookeeper-2                          2/2       Running   2          4h
```

### Deploying application pods

Start deploying the 2 components that are the API server and the order processors.

```
$ oc create -f openshift/01-deployment-api.yaml -n quotegame-rhforum
$ oc create -f openshift/01-deployment-processors.yaml -n quotegame-rhforum
```

Once this is done, you may start interacting with the application using the route attached to the `quotegame-api`. 

```
$ oc get route/quotegame-api -n quotegame-rhforum
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                       PATH      SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
quotegame-api   quotegame-api-quotegame-rhforum.apps.ocp42.ocp42.openshift.fr             quotegame-api   8080-tcp                 None
```

You can register as a user and start buying and selling actions from your portfolio. But for now the value of each symbol remains flat as we are using the `base` version of the `quotegame-processors` container image.

If you want some changes, you may invoke our *Chaos Monkey* by deploying the `quotegame-chaosmonkey` container image with:

```
$ oc create -f openshift/01-deployment-chaosmonkey.yaml -n quotegame-rhforum
```

Monkey will start introducing random variations of both quotes so that the game start being a little more interesting! The variation parameters are setup into the `application.properties` file of the module and are rather self-explanatory:

```
%kube.chaos.frequency=30s
%kube.chaos.symbols=TYR,CYB
%kube.chaos.variation.min=20
%kube.chaos.variation.max=40
```

To check the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler that has been configured onto the API component, you can start simulating load using:

```
$ oc run web-load --rm --attach --restart='Never' --image=jordi/ab -n 80000 -c 20 http://quotegame-api:8080/api/quote/TYR -n quotegame-rhforum
```


### Updating application pods

```
$ oc replace -f openshift/02-deployment-processors-latest.yaml -n quotegame-rhforum
```
